# UI Test Automation Assessment
## Overview
This is a simple UI test automation assesment where you will find an automated test that you need to complete for a shopping web application using C# and Selenium. Please clone this repository, create one repository with your solution and share the link.
## Getting Started
### Requirements
* Visual Studio Code
* .NET
### Visual Studio Code Extensions
Add the following extensions in Visual Studio Code:
* C#
* C# Dev Kit
* .NET Core Test Explorer
### Build/Execute Test Cases
You can build and run the test cases with Visual Studio Code using the *Testing* option in the sidebar. Or you can run them from the *terminal*:
```
$ dotnet test
```
## Tasks
Develop an automated test case for the shopping web application [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/) with the following steps:
1. Login with valid credentials
2. Add two items to the shopping cart
3. Go to the shopping cart
4. Check the prices in the cart for the two items

**Add your test case in the file: tests/TestUI.cs**

You will find the login test case as an example in the same file. You can refactor, add more files, and use any design pattern for your solution.
